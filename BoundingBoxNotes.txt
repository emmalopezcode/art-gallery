Bounding Box Questions

1.  It makes sense to me that the bottom, left, front corner is the min
    and the top, right, back corner is the max. That info is enough to 
    know if a point is inside it etc.

2.  The bounding box can change its position along with the object in a
    fairly natural way, the rotation is what gets weird. Because the bounding
    box only contains information about two points (the max and min) it cannot
    represent an accurate, tight rotation. Instead, it is the smallest contained
    box if it were rotated (0, 0, 0);

3.  It does not, it is always world axis aligned.
